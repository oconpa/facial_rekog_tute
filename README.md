# Facial Rekognition Workshop

> If youâ€™ve built an application using AWS in the past or understand key cloud concepts, this workshop is suited for you. You will use AWS Rekognition to build an online gallery of ML detections, and use AWS services to scan, detect and draw data science inferences from the scans.

## Overview

With a rising potential on what machine learning has to offer, AWS offers an easy plug-n-play module to integrate machine learning services very easily. AWS Rekognition is AWS's inbuilt ML service.

## Setting up your Development Environment

Cloud 9 is AWS's cloud IDE making developing on the cloud much easier. Forget about access keys and secrets, which a cloud 9 environment you can develop from within the VPC.

### Provisioning your Cloud 9 IDE

1. Goto your AWS console via this link: https://aws.amazon.com/

2. Search up 'Cloud 9' in the search bar, and click on the first option.

3. Click 'Create Environment'

4. Set the **name** of your environment to be 'MLWorkshop'.\
   Click 'Next Step'.\
   Under 'Instance Type' select 'Other instance type', and search for 't3.small' in the dropdown search.

5. Leave everything else as default.\
   Click 'Next Step'.\
   Click 'Create Environment'.

### Setting up your Cloud 9 with React application

1. Clone the current repository to your Cloud9 IDE.
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/oconpa/facial_rekog_tute.git
   ```

2. Move into the cloned directory, and install all required packages. 

   ```shell
   cd facial_rekog_tute/frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the React application
   ```shell
   npm run start
   ```
   
4. Preview your Web Application
   
   After the app has compiled successfully, click 'Tools' in the toolbar up top, click 'Preview' and finally click 'Preview Running Application'. 
   Open the preview in another tab by clicking the arrow / box button on the right of the search bar. 
   
**You should see a basic web app in your browser! However, there is currently no functionality. Let's use AWS to fix this!**

---

## Create an S3 + CORS

1. From the aws console, search up 'S3' in the search bar, and click on the first option.  If you can't find it click [here](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=ap-southeast-2#)

2. Click 'Create Bucket'

3. Name your bucket facial-detection-**'Replace with your full name'**

4. Click 'Create'

![Create S3](img/S3Create.png)

5. Goto te bucket you just created, and click on the **Permission** tab. Then to **CORS configuration** and paste the following code:

```code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

5. Click 'Save'

## Create the lambda (backend)

1. From the aws console, search up 'Lambda' in the search bar, and click on the first option.

2. Click 'Create function'

3. On the create function page:
- Name your function **upload**
- Runtime **Python 3.8**

4. Click function

Image

5. Once created click into the Permissions tab. Under **Execution role** will be a role name, Click it.

6. In the newly opened window click on the blue button 'Attach policies'. In the search bar search for the following policies, checking the box once you've found them.
- AmazonS3FullAccess
- AmazonRekognitionFullAccess

7. Click 'Attach policy'

8. After attaching the policy go back to your lambda and under the configuration tab in the function code paste:

```python
import boto3
import json

rekognition = boto3.client('rekognition')
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
bucket_name = "facial-detection-paulkukiel"

                    if age > 89:
                        chart[5] += 1
                    elif age > 69:
                        chart[4] += 1
                    elif age > 49:

# Delete Method
def doDelete(event):
    data = event['queryStringParameters']['fileName']
    key = data.split('/')[3].split('?')[0]
    s3.delete_object( Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key )
    s3.delete_object( Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key[:-4] + '.json' )
    return json.dumps({'Message': 'Success'})
```

9. On line 6 you will need to replace 'REPLACEME' with the bucket you created earlier on. E.g. if you named your bucket facial-detection-johnsmith, then line 6 would look like

```python
bucket_name = "facial-detection-johnsmith"
```

6. Click 'Save'

## Create and Expose API Gateway

We now need a way to expose the lambda function to the world, we can acomplish this with APIGateway.  In the AWS Console serach for 'api gateway' or click [here](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/apis).  In the top right click "Create API".  There are number of Gateways we can create we will select "REST API" (note don't accidentally select the REST API private)  Click "Build".

![Create REST](img/restapi-1.png)

We will be creating a new REST Api, give your API a name, "rekognition" will work for this example.  Then click "Create API"

![Create REST](img/restapi-2.png)

Click "Actions" and select "Create Resource"

![Create resource](img/creatresource-1.png)

Select the check box "Configure as proxy resourse".  We want every request to be passed directly to the lambda function created, applicaiton code will take care of the http method.  Click "Create Resource"

![Create resource](img/creatresource-2.png)

Type in the name of the lambda function we created "rekognition" and click save, when requested to confirm permission click "OK" we are allowing this API Gateway to invike the lambda function.

![Create resource](img/creatresource-3.png)
 
We have now configured the API but not yet deployed it. Click "Actions" then "Deploy API", int eh drop down for Deployment Stage select "[New Stage]", privide "default" as the name then click deploy.

![Deploy](img/stage.png)

You will see a **Invoke URL**  copy this you will need it in the front end app.  This is the http endpoint, effectly the entry point to our lambda function from the world.

## Connecting the React Frontend to the Upload Route Backend

1. From the API Gateway opened up in the last step there should be a **Stages**, option on the left, click into it.

2. Expand all the menus under default until you see the GET method under /upload. Click into it and copy the **Invoke URL**

3. Navigate back to your cloud 9. On line 42 of frontend/src/Pages/Dropzone.js you will subsitute **REPLACE ME** with the API link you copied from API Gateway concatenating with the following "?fileName=" string. The link should look similar to this, but with your unique API link:

```javascript
"https://qvvnlsnd4l.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/default/upload?fileName=" +
```

4. Test the app

## Detection Time

Congradulations on getting this far in the workshop. As promised this section is your opportunity to reap on some AWS credits. In this workshop we have 4 challenges for you to try out. Each challenge realtes to one functionality in the ML React App, and should ahev an attach gif explaining on how this functionality works. Your job is to add the code for each challenege to the lambda you provisioned above, open the route just like you did for the upload route on the API you created, and find where that route is added in the react app. 

For reference as you complete the challeneges your app should run similar to http://facial-hosting.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/

Good luck, remember the faster you complete the challeneges and show to your trainer, the more points you accumulate to win some AWS credits. Feel free to message you're designated breakout room AWS reps for hints and help.

5. Test APP.

And that's it you've made it to the end. Let your trainer know so your in the running to get some AWS credits. Don't forget to complete the survey and join the AWS facebook to keep up with all things AWS.
